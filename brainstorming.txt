[ ] Suggest new ideas below

NEW IDEAS:
----------
[ ] **Auto-scaling for mixed value ranges** - Automatically scale huge values (like RPM) and small values (like boost, AFR) to be visible in the same plot without manual scaling. Target: RPM to 0.06 or similar scale factor so all plot lines are visible with proper gradients.

[ ] **Multiple file upload and comparison** - Allow users to upload multiple CSV/log files simultaneously and compare them side-by-side for analysis. Include file management, side-by-side plotting, and difference highlighting.

[ ] **Plot performance optimization** - Find ways to make plot generation quick and smoother, reduce lag and improve responsiveness.

[ ] **Mini plot click responsiveness** - Minimize delay between click in mini plots and blob generation with value display on the map.

[ ] **ChatGPT-style sidebar** - Implement proper mobile sidebar similar to ChatGPT mobile app for better navigation and controls.

[ ] **User feedback system** - Add input area for users to report issues, suggest ideas, and request features to be implemented.

[ ] **GTR R35 Super App** - Comprehensive platform focusing exclusively on GTR R35: DTCs, system descriptions, engine/gearbox building guides, upgrades, technical documents, installation procedures, overhaul steps, tuning strategies, and integration with log viewer.

MOBILE WEB APP UPDATES & BUG FIXES:
====================================
[ ] **Research similar graph view software** - Study how other graph visualization tools handle performance, UX, and mobile optimization to improve the app.

[ ] **Landscape navigation sidebar** - Implement sidebar navigation for mobile landscape mode, especially in mega plot view where users get trapped in the graph area. Allows full page navigation even when plot is optimized for full-screen viewing.

[ ] **Power-based scaling system** - Replace linear scale with power-based scaling: scale value 1 = x^0 (linear), scale 2 = x^1, scale 0 = x^-1, etc. This allows proper visualization when mixing parameters with vastly different ranges (e.g., RPM 1000-8000 vs AFR 0-30) without manually setting extreme scale values like 0.02.

[ ] **Fluctuation/spike visualization** - For parameters like wheel speed and clutch slip where sudden changes are critical, implement better visualization for minute fluctuations even with large data samples. Prioritize showing important change points and spikes.

[ ] **Optimize mini plot sampling** - Reduce lag in mini time plots by optimizing data sampling. Implement spike detection/prioritization algorithm so critical spikes are always visible even when sample size is reduced.

[ ] **Mega plot templates** - Implement template selection system:
    - General: Engine RPM, AFR Bank 1 & 2, Vehicle Speed, 4WL Split
    - Fuel: AFR1 & 2, STFT 1 & 2, Injector Lag Time, etc.
    - Wheel Spin: Wheel Speed FR, FL, RR, RL, Engine RPM, etc.
    Quick-switch between pre-configured parameter groups for common analysis scenarios.

[ ] **Mobile side pull menu** - Implement side pull/drawer menu for mobile view to improve navigation and access to controls without cluttering the main interface.
